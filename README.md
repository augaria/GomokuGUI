Description:

It's a Gomoku battle system, including both the online and offline parts.

For the offline part, the system provides a AI agent to play against the user. The AI agent is designed based on Alpha-Beta pruning and optimized for this game.The agent can predict for 3 to 5 future steps. The more steps it predicts, the better performance it shows when making a choice, but will have larger time and space cost.

For the online, the system enables the multiplayer battle and online chatting. Users can see all the online players and send a battle invitation to anyone of them. The user who receives the invitation can decide whether to accept it. A user can only have a battle with one online player at the same time but can chat with many online players using the message box. The system also provides a ranking board, from which users can see the rankings for all players, the win rates of all modes for a certain player, and also the playbacks for all online battles and some offline battles that user authorizes to upload.
